<h1>The Best Movies According to Prerna</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all time.</h2>
<hr>
<h3>Meg 2:The Trench</h3> 
<p>Anyone hoping that Ben Wheatley might bring some of the exuberant personality and boundary-pushing creativity on display in films like “Kill List” and “In the Earth” to his for-hire gig directing the dismally boring “Meg 2: The Trench” should find different cinematic waters to swim in. Much as in his atrocious remake of “Rebecca” in 2020, Wheatley mostly phones it in here, and he does so with a rotary landline. At least until the final half-hour, when he’s finally free to unleash some monstrous chaos, this is one of the dullest films of the year, a plodding, poorly made giant shark movie that inexplicably lets the giant shark take a backseat to an evil underwater drilling operation. This thing just has no teeth.</p>
<h3>365 Days</h3>
<p>“365 Days: This Day” is a movie about sex and shopping. Who doesn’t like sex and shopping? Viewed through this narrow lens, it makes sense that the Polish erotic romance “365 Days” rose to popularity, first in cinemas and then on Netflix, where viewers could indulge their most prurient interests in private. But the following for the franchise that sprung from that surprise hit stands in defiant opposition to the quality of the films themselves. It’s stunning how blatantly this Euro-softcore series rips off "Fifty Shades of Grey," itself “Twilight” fan fiction blown up to mega-hit size. And that’s the least of these movies’ issues. </p>
<h3>Rocky Aur Rani ki Prem Kahani</h3>
<p>"Rocky aur Rani ki prem kahani" is a must-watch Bollywood movie directed by the master storyteller, Karan Johar. With mind-blowing performances, a heartwarming storyline, empowering themes, and exceptional cinematography, it has all the elements to leave you thoroughly entertained and moved. Whether you're a fan of romantic comedies or not, this film is bound to win your heart. Don't miss out on this beautiful cinematic journey! #RockyAurRaniKiPremKahani #BollywoodMovieReview #KaranJoharMagic</p>
